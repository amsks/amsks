Master student in the EIT Digital Master's course in Autonomous systems, working towards a specialization in Connected Robotics and Reinforcement Learning. I have previously worked in various fields in hardware and software, and on projects that range from cognitive radios to RTOS stacks, and now I aim to combine them and become a researcher in the field of AI.
